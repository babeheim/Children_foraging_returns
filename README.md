# Children_foraging_returns
## Abstract
Childhood is a period of life unique to humans. Childhood may have evolved through the need to acquire knowledge and subsistence skills. In an attempt to evaluate the importance of learning for the evolution of childhood, previous research examined the increase with age of returns to foraging. Any increase could be due to increases in knowledge or other factors such as body size and strength. In a population of part time children foragers on the island of Pemba, Tanzania, we collected anthropometric measures such as size and strength (N: 202), estimated knowledge (N: 93) and observed a variety of foraging trips (N trips: 310, N individuals: 116). We estimate the contribution of the different elements to foraging success. Clearly defining the relative importance of somatic versus cognitive traits of forager children provides clues about the selective pressures leading to the evolution of early life history traits in our species.
